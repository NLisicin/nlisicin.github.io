## Problems with Trading

If you are having problems with quick or advanced trades, it may be caused by one or more of the following issues. Here you will find information on how to solve each of these problems.

### Insufficient Funds

You may not have enough funds in your account to make your trade. There are multiple ways to fund your account on Coinsquare.

Further instructions on available funding methods can be found [here](https://help.coinsquare.com/hc/en-us/categories/115000433631-Deposits-Withdrawals).

### Open Orders

Having even one open order for an advanced trade may prevent you from to completing a quick trade. The funds allocated for your advanced trade are put on hold until the order is filled, so you will either have to cancel your open order or reduce the amount of your quick trade. 

You can learn how to cancel an open order [here](https://help.coinsquare.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032261291-How-To-Cancel-an-Open-Order).

### Unverified Account

You must have a verified account in order to trade. Identity verification is a legal requirement of trading platforms in Canada. A verified account will have a blue **VERIFIED** box in the top right corner of the dashboard next to your username. 

To verify your account, refer to step 3 in the instructions [here](docs/create-account).
