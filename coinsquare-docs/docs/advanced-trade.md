# Set Up an Advanced Trade

These instructions will guide you through the process of setting up an advanced trade in Coinsquare.

Advanced trades allow you to place a buy or sell order that will automatically execute when a currency reaches a chosen price threshold. This way, you can plan in advance the trades that you want to make without worrying about missing your chance if there are sudden market changes.

1. Click **Advanced Trade** in the top menu bar.

To trade between two non-Bitcoin currencies, trade from the first currency to Bitcoin then trade from Bitcoin to the second currency.

3. Click **BUY BTC** or **SELL BTC** to trade to or from Bitcoin, respectively.

4. Enter a **Limit price** to determine the price point at which your trade will execute.

    The **Actual limit price** displayed below your **Limit price** may vary slightly from the amount you enter. This is because markets are priced in bits. Your limit will be automatically rounded to the nearest bit.

5. Enter the amount you want to invest upon reaching the **Limit price**, or select a percentage of your current balance you want to invest.

    Your **Total receiving** will automatically update to show an estimate of the amount you will receive when the trade executes. This estimate does not include fees, which are displayed above the **Total receiving**.

6. Click **PLACE BUY ORDER**.

    A **Buy Order Confirmation** will pop up. Here you can review your trade before finalizing.

7. Click **BUY**.

Your advanced trade has now been successfully placed! It will appear in your list of **Open Orders** where it can be reviewed or cancelled. When your selected currency reaches the limit price, the trade will automatically execute.
