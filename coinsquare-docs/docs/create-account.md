# Create and Verify an Account

These instructions will guide you through the process of creating and verifying an account so you can begin using Coinsquare.

Verifying your account is necessary before you can buy or sell currency. It is used to confirm your identity and prevent illegal trading.

## Required Materials

Photos or scans of the front and back of two documents to verify your identity.
Files must be less than 3.5 MB and can be in JPG, JPEG, PNG, PDF, or GIF format. You will require the following:
* One piece of government-issued photo ID. Either a driver’s license, national ID card, or passport.
* One proof of address less than three months old. Either a water bill, electricity bill, internet bill, cable bill, or bank account statement.
