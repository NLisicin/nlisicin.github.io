# Introduction
{: .no_toc }

Coinsquare is an online platform for buying and selling cryptocurrency. It allows users to track recent market changes, buy and sell a multitude of digital currencies, and plan future trades that execute automatically.

These instructions will guide you through the process of [creating and verifying an account](docs/create-account), [executing a quick trade](docs/quick-trade), and [setting up an advanced trade](docs/advanced-trade). They will take you through the technical steps, but are not intended to give advice or suggestions on how to manage your money.
