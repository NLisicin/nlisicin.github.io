# Coinsquare Docs

These docs guide a beginner user through the basic functions of Coinsquare, a cryptocurrency trading platform. They explain how to create and verify an account, execute a quick trade, and set up an advanced trade.

When writing the instructions, we were able to leverage our different skill levels to our advantage. Sarah is familiar with cryptocurrency and uses Coinsquare herself, so we had the expertise needed to explain every step of the process. Nicholas had no prior experience with cryptocurrency, so we could check whether our instructions would make sense to a beginner user.

We began by choosing the conventions we wanted to follow in our instructions, then divided the workload evenly and wrote our sections independently. After writing, we collaborated to make sure all our pages were consistent in style and tone and that every part of the instructions was clear and easily understood by a new user.
